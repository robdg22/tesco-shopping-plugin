- **Accessibility**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- **Performance**: Use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration

### Key Animation Patterns
1. **Segment Control**: Clip-path sliding with 300ms ease-in-out
2. **Filter Chips**: Circle expansion with spring physics
3. **Product Cards**: Hover scale (1.02x) and shadow elevation
4. **Search Results**: Staggered entrance animations (50ms delay)
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton shimmer and pulse effects

### UI Components to Customize
- **Buttons**: Add boop, gradient, and glowing variants
- **Inputs**: Focus scaling and error state animations
- **Cards**: Interactive hover effects and variants
- **Tabs**: Smooth indicator sliding
- **Modals**: Backdrop blur and scale entrance
